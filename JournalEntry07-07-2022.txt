Today marks my second full day in Hanalei. I find that there is no real way for me to combat my continuous feeling of complacency and, therefore, laziness. I guess that creating a coding program like this is a step in the right direction, but it feels like coding and fucking around on a computer are synonomous in the eyes of those I respect. I also find that I am exteremly embarresed to play guitar in front of others which is my secod non lazy task. So I constantly scroll though instagram or read webtoons to eliviate my boredom. The only actions that I am willing to do are those that produce laziness. adrenaline, or semen. But I rarely take independent action to find girls, espically through social media. These diaries are the start of my self refection and my indipendent writing process. Its kinda exciting. It just started raining. God, I love the rain.  ALso while I was on the plane ride to hawaii I decided that I wanted to spend a year abroad after college I am wishing to attend a Buddhist temple in China to learn spirttual values and attain happiness seprate from the capitialist view of success. Althought, I could see this want being a fad in my mind, as an two articles I read inspired me to do that.
