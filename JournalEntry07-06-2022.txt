As I live my first day back as a tourist, I have realized many things: I am obessed with college and futher education, I barely know anything about the real world, and that I finally understand how racism is passed on. going with the more intresting option here, here comes racisim. While in am in hanalei, my cousins and realtives who live here have passed on thier hatred for tourists. It is very intereseting because I believe myself to not judge others by thier looks, but while I am here I find myself hating the exact thing that I currently am. this is an interesting construct that I hope to explore in order to be able to stop my self from developing racist tendicies while around racist people.
